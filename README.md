# cge-scraper
This is a bot to scrape the webpage of the Spanish consulate in Buenos Aires. 

I need my passport but they won't make it easy, so I will just automate this shit.

## How to use it?

Just download the project, create a `.env` file and fill in what is asked, then run it with `npm start` and everything should be fine.

## Recommended

Run the command `npm run ttest` to check if the telegram message is working properly
